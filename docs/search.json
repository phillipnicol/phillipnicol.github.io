    "section": "",
    "text": "It is well known that the ratio of two independent standard normals \\(Z_1/Z_2\\) follows a Cauchy distribution. But what about the ratio of two (independent) Cauchy distributions? ChatGPT confidently tells me that it is still a Cauchy distribution. I almost agreed it with it and went on to have a productive day, but got suspicious after the following simulation:\n\nset.seed(1)\nx &lt;- rcauchy(n=10^4); y &lt;- rcauchy(n=10^4)\nr &lt;- x/y\n\n#Quantiles of cauchy \nquantile(x, c(0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 0.975))\n\n        2.5%           5%          25%          50%          75%          95% \n-12.20648869  -6.24480097  -0.93010302   0.01295798   1.04038961   6.28112571 \n       97.5% \n 13.14378604 \n\n#Quantiles of ratio of cauchy\nquantile(r, c(0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 0.975))\n\n         2.5%            5%           25%           50%           75% \n-37.319835916 -14.631235783  -0.962655232   0.001017854   0.985213988 \n          95%         97.5% \n 14.609945616  33.499447199 \n\n\nAlthough the quartiles match up, the ratio appears to have significantly heavier tails.\nThe density of the ratio \\(U\\), \\(f_U(u)\\), can be computed by the standard approach for (ratio distributions):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\nf_(u) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{|v|}{\\pi^2 (1 + (uv)^2)(1+v^2)} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 (1 + u^2 s)(1+s )ds }\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nSir Dhav recognized that the integrand has a partial fraction decomposition:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 (1 + u^2 s)(1+s )} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2(u^2-1)} \\left( \\frac{u^2}{1+u^2 s} - \\frac{1}{1+s} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThus\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf_U(u) &= \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 (u^2 - 1)} \\left( \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\int_0^M \\frac{u^2}{1+u^2 s} ds - \\int_0^M \\frac{1}{1+s}ds \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 (u^2 -1)} \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln(1 + u^2 M) - \\ln(1+M) \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\log u^2}{\\pi^2 (u^2-1)}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich is definitely not a Cauchy distribution. By the way, this is one of the weirdest densities I have ever seen, \\(f(u) \\to \\infty\\) as \\(u \\to 0\\) and \\(f\\) is indeterminate at \\(u = \\pm 1\\) (the limit may be evaluated using L’hospital’s rule). Here is a plot comparing the Cauchy density (red) to its ratio (blue). Strangely enough, this plot shows seems to show that the ratio density has lighter tails, which is not in line with the simulation. Hm?\n\nAfter deriving this, I found this old paper with the same result:\nRide, P. R. (1965). Distributions of product and quotient of Cauchy variables. The American Mathematical Monthly, 72(3), 303-305.\nThis means ChatGPT is at least 60 years behind cutting edge statistics!"
