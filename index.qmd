I am a fifth year PhD student in Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, where I am co-advised by Dr. Rafael Irizarry and Dr. Jeff Miller. Prior to joining the Biostatistics department, I was a mathematics major at Harvard.

My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics and genomics. My recent work includes:

1.  Dimensionality reduction for single-cell genomic data
2.  Methodology for spatial transcriptomics
3.  Integration of high-dimensional random matrices
